Flutter Switch is used to switch a setting between on/off. When the switch is on, the value returned by the Switch onChanged property is true, while the switch is off, onChanged property returns false. 
Create a new Flutter application and replace main.dart with the code I provided. After runinug the application you should see the output as I also provided in the captures.
